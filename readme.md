### About ME
I live in the city of YOKOHAMA, JAPAN

I love different languages

I speak English, Chinese and a little bit Japanese and I wish to master German and French one day (maybe even more after that:))

*The limit of my language means the limits of my world*

**AND**

*The more languages you know, the more people you are*

My friends is my family ❤️❤️❤️ I love my friends

Lorenzo is my amaboy(アマボエ), he has a warm, gentle and beautiful heart.

He cooks nice, healthy food for me.

He has a cat called Fredi back in Germany.

I hope I can meet Fredi someday:)

I am not picky with what I eat as long as it's healthy and fresh(I microwave raw beef and eat them without adding any seasonings :) scary huh)

But I do love
- *Chocolate* noir
- *les fromages* almost all of them
- *french fries* real potatoes
- i dont like sweet things unless there is chocolate in it, not even most of the fruits

I am listening to those all the time:)
1. **Stromae** *Carmen*
2. **Shakira** *Antes de las seis*
3. **Sia** *Bird set free*
4. **Mecano** *Hijo de la luna*
5. Musicals like *Notre Dame De Paris*,*Fiddler on the roof*

I enjoy reading very much
- Epic fantasy like *The first law*,*The Farseer*,and of course everybody knows *a song of ice and fire*
- Science fiction, favourite one is always *hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy*
- *brave new world*,*the social contract*,*1984*...stop saying Jean-Jacques Rousseau was liberal you bloody stupid French people
- I love classics as well *Victor Hugo*,*Dickens*,
- I am very interested in Hermann Hesse recently because of Lorenzo

I wish to meet Matthew Youlden, check this video you'll find he's freaking amazing[how to learn any language easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr_poW-KK1Q)
