### natural language processing is the light of my life

### About ME
I live in the city of YOKOHAMA, JAPAN

I love different languages and I wish to master German and French one day (maybe even more after that:))
I believe
*The limit of my language means the limits of my world*
**AND**
*The more languages you know, the more people you are* :)

I recently hooked up with a really good looking half ltalian half German dude called Lorenzo
But after getting to know him I decided not to ruin this friendship cuz he is such a great person.
Lorenzo has a cat called Fredi back in Germany
I hope I can meet Fredi someday:)

I am not picky with what I eat as long as it's healthy and fresh(I micro wave raw beef and eat them without adding any seasonings)
But I do love
- *Chocolate* noir
- *les fromages* almost all of them
- *french fries* real potatoes
- i dont like sweet things unless there is chocolate in it, not even most of the fruits

Music-wise I am into
1. *Stromae*
2. *Shakira*
3. *Hijo de la luna* is my anthem
4. Musicals like *Les miserables*,*Fiddler on the roof*
5. ALL THE TIME

I enjoy reading very much
- Epic fantasy *the first law*,*the Farseer*,and of course everybody knows *a song of ice and fire*
- Science fiction, favourite one is always *hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy*
- *brave new world*,*the social contract*,*1984*...stop saying Jean-Jacques Rousseau was liberal you bloody stupid French people
- I am very interested in Hermann Hesse recently because of Lorenzo

I wish to meet Matthew Youlden, check this video you'll find he's fucking amazing[how to learn any language easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr_poW-KK1Q)
